Clean-Pendle Pipeline Mapping
This document provides a detailed mapping of the data science pipeline in the sboettcher-ub313/Clean-Pendle repository, focusing on the generator.py file and the A4_PredictiveModeling/phase_1 directory. It summarizes the contents of each component, explains their relationships, and presents a tree diagram of the pipeline.
Repository Overview
The Clean-Pendle repository implements a data science pipeline for analyzing Pendle Protocol data, likely related to DeFi metrics such as token prices or liquidity pools. The pipeline is structured as follows:

pendle_project/src/synthesis/generator.py:
A Python script containing the core pipeline stages: data aggregation, dataset creation, preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
Sections: A0_DataAggregation, A1_CreatingDatasets, A2_DataPreprocessing, A3_FeatureEngineering, A4_PredictiveModeling.


A4_PredictiveModeling/phase_1:
A directory containing scripts for predictive modeling implementation.
Key files: A4_0_ModelingEnvironmentSetup.py, A4_1_ModelingAndAnalysis.py.



Component Summaries
generator.py
The generator.py file defines a sequential pipeline for processing Pendle Protocol data.

A0_DataAggregation:

Purpose: Collects raw data from Pendle Protocol (e.g., via blockchain APIs or smart contracts).
Details: Likely uses libraries like web3.py or requests to fetch token prices, pool metrics, or transaction logs.
Output: Raw datasets (e.g., JSON, CSV).


A1_CreatingDatasets:

Purpose: Structures raw data into tabular datasets.
Details: Processes data into DataFrames using pandas, creating time-series or cross-sectional datasets.
Output: Structured datasets (e.g., CSV files, DataFrames).


A2_DataPreprocessing:

Purpose: Cleans and prepares datasets for analysis.
Details: Handles missing values, outliers, and normalization using pandas, numpy, or sklearn.preprocessing.
Output: Preprocessed datasets.


A3_FeatureEngineering:

Purpose: Creates predictive features.
Details: Derives features like moving averages or volatility metrics using pandas or sklearn.
Output: Feature-engineered datasets.


A4_PredictiveModeling:

Purpose: Configures the predictive modeling process.
Details: Defines model selection and training pipelines, linking to scripts in A4_PredictiveModeling/phase_1.
Output: Modeling configuration or orchestration.



A4_PredictiveModeling/phase_1
This directory contains scripts for executing predictive modeling.

A4_0_ModelingEnvironmentSetup.py:

Purpose: Configures the modeling environment.
Details: Loads dependencies (e.g., sklearn, tensorflow), sets random seeds, and prepares data pipelines.
Output: A ready-to-use modeling environment.


A4_1_ModelingAndAnalysis.py:

Purpose: Trains and evaluates models.
Details: Implements model training (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM), hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
Output: Trained models, metrics, and visualizations.



Relationship Details
The components form a linear pipeline, with each stage depending on the previous one’s output:

A0_DataAggregation → A1_CreatingDatasets:

A0 fetches raw data (e.g., token price histories), which A1 structures into datasets (e.g., time-series DataFrames).
Example: A0 retrieves JSON data from a blockchain API, and A1 converts it to a CSV with columns like timestamp, price.


A1_CreatingDatasets → A2_DataPreprocessing:

A1’s structured datasets are cleaned by A2 to remove inconsistencies (e.g., missing values, outliers).
Example: A1 produces a DataFrame with missing entries, which A2 imputes using mean values.


A2_DataPreprocessing → A3_FeatureEngineering:

A2’s preprocessed datasets are used by A3 to create features like moving averages or liquidity ratios.
Example: A2 normalizes price data, and A3 calculates a 7-day volatility metric.


A3_FeatureEngineering → A4_PredictiveModeling (in generator.py):

A3’s feature-engineered datasets are input to A4, which sets up modeling tasks.
Example: A3 creates features like “price volatility,” which A4 uses to configure a regression model.


A4_PredictiveModeling → A4_PredictiveModeling/phase_1:

A4 in generator.py orchestrates modeling, delegating implementation to phase_1 scripts.
Example: A4 specifies a model type (e.g., XGBoost), and A4_1_ModelingAndAnalysis.py trains it.


A4_0_ModelingEnvironmentSetup.py → A4_1_ModelingAndAnalysis.py:

A4_0 prepares the environment (e.g., loads data), which A4_1 uses for training and evaluation.
Example: A4_0 loads a feature dataset, and A4_1 trains a Random Forest model on it.
